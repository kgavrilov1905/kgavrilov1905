# Hey, I'm Kirill! :wave:

I'm currently a fourth year Statistics student at Simon Fraser University :mortar_board: with experience in industry and research. I worked on implementing machine learning for in situ iron sensing apparatus, as well as supplementary statistical analysis at CarboNet Nanotechnologies. I'm enthusiastic about mentoring science and technology students!
